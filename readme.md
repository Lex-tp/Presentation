## 3. Slide №3
* #### TypeScript is a programming language which was developed by Microsoft. It is free, open source and superset of the JavaScript.

## 4. Slide №4
* #### Maintained by Microsoft, the language comes with an addition of class-based object oriented programming, as well as optional static typing to the JavaScript.
	 #### 1. What is object-oriented programming?
	* #### Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses abstractions to create models based on real-world objects. OOP uses several techniques from previously 	recognized paradigms, including:
 	    - #### modularity; 
	    - #### polymorphism;
	    - #### encapsulation.
	* #### What is Inheritance in OOP? In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar 	implementation.
	* #### What is Polymorphism? Polymorphism in programming languages is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types.
	* #### What is Encapsulation? In object-oriented programming, encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of 	direct access to some 	of an object's components. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing 	unauthorized parties' direct access to them.

## 5. Slide №5
* #### Using TypeScript is possible to create JavaScript applications for the client or server side.

## 6. Slide №6
* #### TypeScript has been created to tackle the development of large programs. Being a superset of the JavaScript, it can be transcompiled to the latter and all JavaScript programs can be considered as TypeScript programs. In addition, the language has support for definition files containing type information of current JavaScript libraries. This feature is quite similar to header files in the C or C++ languages which describe the structure of current object files. As a result, other programs can make use of these values and act as entities which were typed statically using TypeScript.

## 7. Slide №7 
* #### How does JavaScript understand TypeScript features? There is a JavaScript engine that reads and executes your code. But JavaScript engines are not able to read TypeScript code so any TypeScript file should go under a "pre-translation" process, called compilation. Only after the first compilation step you're left with pure JavaScript code.

## 8. Slide №8 
### What is the meaning of TypeScript?

* #### Firstly, it should be noted that TypeScript is a strongly typed and compiled language, which will probably be closer to Java, C #, and other strongly typed languages. Strict typing at run time reduces the number of potential errors that might occur when developing in JavaScript.Also, TypeScript’s potential makes it faster and easier to write large complex integrated programs, respectively, it is easier to maintain, develop, scale and test them than with standard JavaScript.

## 9. Slide №9 
### Becoming TypeScript
* #### TypeScript was first made public in October 2012, after two years of internal development at Microsoft. Soon after the announcement, Miguel de Icaza praised the language itself, but criticized the lack of mature IDE support apart from Microsoft Visual Studio, which was not available on Linux and OS X at that time. 
* #### TypeScript 0.9, released in 2013, added support for generics. 
* #### TypeScript 1.0 was released at Microsoft's Build developer conference in 2014.

## 10. Slide №10
* #### In July 2014, the development team announced a new TypeScript compiler, claiming 5 times performance gains. Simultaneously, the source code, which was initially hosted on CodePlex, was moved to GitHub.

## 11. Slide №11
* #### On 22 September 2016, TypeScript 2.0 was released; it introduced several features, including the ability for programmers to optionally prevent variables from being assigned null values, sometimes referred to as the billion-dollar mistake.
* #### TypeScript 3.0 was released on 30 July 2018, bringing many language additions like tuples in rest parameters and spread expressions, rest parameters with tuple types, generic rest parameters and so on.

## 12. Slide №12 
### ECMAScript 2015 support

* #### TypeScript adds support for features such as classes, modules, and an arrow function syntax as defined in the ECMAScript 2015 standard.

## 13. Slide №13
### Additional TypeScript features include:
- #### Type annotations and compile-time type checking
- #### Type inference
- #### Type erasure
- #### Interfaces
- #### Enumerated types
- #### Generics
- #### Namespaces
- #### Tuples
- #### Async/await
### The following features are backported from ECMAScript 2015:
- #### Classes
- #### Modules
- #### Abbreviated "arrow" syntax for anonymous functions
- #### Optional parameters and default parameters

## 14. Slide №14
### IDE and editor support
* #### Today there is support TypeScript in more IDEs, particularly in Eclipse, via a plugin contributed by Palantir Technologies. Various text editors, including Emacs, Vim, Webstorm,  Atom and Microsoft's own Visual Studio Code also support TypeScript.

## 15. Slide №15
### Conclusion
* #### TypeScript is more than justified in large projects. This is due to the fact that the development on it takes longer than on JavaScript, due to the fact that instead of methods and classes it is necessary to describe their declarations. Nevertheless, as long as there is no static typing in JavaScript, TypeScript is a great alternative.
